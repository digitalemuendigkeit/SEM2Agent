# SEM2ABM

This is the repository for our paper 'SEM2Agent - A Protocol for the Use of Structural Equation Model Data in Agent-Based Models'.
It contains:
* The code for the two agent-based models we demonstrated our scheme on
* A website where the scheme application and the results for both agent-based models is documented
