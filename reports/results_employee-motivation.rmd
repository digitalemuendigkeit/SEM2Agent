These are the results of the application of the Employee motivation agent-based model.
This model serves as a demonstration of SEM2Agent scheme for an ABM based on the SEM in:

In experiment 1, stress increases from below 0.0 to almost 0.5. Contrary, motivation and company success decrease from 0.0 or above to around -0.35. The fraction of nice employees shortly increases and then decreases a bit over the 50 model runs. The change of the fraction of nice employees remains small.

# Summary
Shortly describe results of experiments.

## Experiment 1

## Experiment 2
In experiment 2, stress decreases weakly. Motivation and company success increase weakly. The fracion of nice employees remains almost the same over the model runs. 

## Experiment 3
In experiment 3, the stress starts lower, increases a bit in the beginning and decreases then continuous over the model runs. Motivation and company success increase over the model runs, but less strongly then stress decreases. The fraction of nice employees does not change over the model runs. 

## Experiment 4
In experiment 4, the stress decreases strongly in the first model run and increases strongly ober some model runs. Then, the stress decreases weakly until the 10th model run and then increases over the remaining model runs. The motivation first remains the same. Then the motivation increases for some model runs and then decreases more strongly and over more model runs. After a very weakly increase, the motivation decreases again weakly over the remaining model runs. In contrast to the previous experiments, company success does not have the same course over all model runs. In the beginning, company success srarts higher. It decreases strongly in the beginning, then it decreases a bit weaker, before it increases weakly together with motivation. Then both, company success and motivation decrease weakly over the remaining runs. Like in most experiments, the fraction of nice employees does not really change over the model runs. 

## Experiment 5
In experiment 5, the stress decreases strongly in the beginning. Then, it increases a little bit. From model run 5, the stress decreases weakly until around the 30th model run and then remains almost the same over the remaining model runs. The motivation increases strongly in the beginning, then decreases a little bit and then increases weakly until around the 30th model run. Then it remains almost the same until model step 50. The company succcess decreases shortly and strongly in the beginning and then it increases weakly and then runs like the motivation staying almost the same for the remainig model runs. Like in most experiments, the fraction of nice employees does not really change over the model runs. 

## Experiment 6
In experiment 6, stress decreases strongly in the beginning. Then, stress increases very weakly for a few model runs and decreases likewise very weakly for some model runs. For the remaining model runs, stress decreases further and a bit stronger, but still relatively weak. The motivation increases strongly in the beginning, remains the same for a few model runs and then increases over the remaining model runs. The company success decreases in the beginning, stays the same fpr one model run and then increases over the remaining model runs in parallel with the motivation. The fraction of nice employees increases weakly in the beginning and then remains the same until the 50th model run. 

## Experiment 7
In experiment 7, the stress increases strongly in the beginning. Then the stress remains the same for one model run and decreases a bit. Over around 20 model runs, the stress remains then almost the same and increases only very weakly. Then, stress increases a bit stronger until the 50th model run. The motivation decreases stongly in the beginning, thent it remains the same for one model run and increases a little bit for another model run. Then it increaes weakly for some model runs, before it decreases weakly for the remaining model runs. The company success increases relatively strongly in the beginning and then a bit weaker.Theb it decreases weakly, before it runs parallel to the motivation. The fraction of nice employees increases in the beginning and remains then the same until the 50th model run. 

## Experiment 8
In experiment 8, stress increases strongly in the beginning. Then it decreases a little bit and stays then the same for the remaining model runs. The motivation decreases likewise strongly in the beginning, remains the same for one model run, increases weakly for another model run and stays then the same for the remaining model runs. The company success increases relatively strongly in the beginning, then weakly and decreases then weakly, before it runs in parallel with the motivation staying the same until the 50th model run. The fraction of nice employees increases weakly in the beginning, decreases weakly and then remains the same until the 50th model run. 

## Experiment 9
In experiment 9, the stress increases strongly in the beginning, then it increases weakly, before it decreases for the remaining model runs. The motivation decreases strongly in the beginning, stays the same for one model run and increases then for the remaining model steps. The company success increases strongly in the beginning, then weakly and then in parallel to the motivation. The fraction of nice employees increases in the beginning and remains then the same until the 50th model run.
