The SEM2Agent scheme facilitates the systematic use of structural equation model data in agent-based models.
On this website, we demonstrate the application of this scheme for two models, and present the model results.
The code for both models and this website can be found at [https://github.com/digitalemuendigkeit/SEM2Agent](https://github.com/digitalemuendigkeit/SEM2Agent).

The paper with the title "SEM2Agent - A Scheme for the Use of Structural Equation Model Data in Agent-Based Models" will be presented at the [Social Science Conference 2021](https://ssc2021.uek.krakow.pl/).
Once the proceedings are published, a DOI will be added to this site.
